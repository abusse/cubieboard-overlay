Cleaning
--------

To be on safe side erase the first part of your SD Card.
If you wish to keep the partition table, run:

```		
dd if=/dev/zero of=${card} bs=1k count=1023 seek=1
```

Bootloader
----------

You will need the combined u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin file.
If you don't have it yet, refer to [[http://linux-sunxi.org/U-Boot#Compilation]]


```
dd if=u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=${card} bs=1024 seek=8
```

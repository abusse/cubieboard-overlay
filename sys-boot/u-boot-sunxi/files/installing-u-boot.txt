# Installing u-boot.

The region with offset 8K and size 32K contains the SPL initial loader, so
let's
write that away to the disk:

```
dd if=u-boot-sunxi/spl/sunxi-spl.bin of=${disk} bs=1024 seek=8
```

The next region of 512K contains u-boot:

```
dd if=u-boot-sunxi/u-boot.img of=${disk} bs=1024 seek=40
```

Finally, the next 128K contains the environment, let's clear that:

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=${disk} bs=1024 count=128 seek=552
```
